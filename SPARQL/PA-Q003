#The following SPARQL query allows you to find the datasets 
#that are overlapped in your geographic coverage. Since the datasets 
#have a geometry associated geo:hasGeometry we can find those that 
#overlap their coverage area with the function geo:sfOverlaps. 
#This query is very interesting since it allows us to know which 
#oceanographic campaigns were in the same area and thus be 
#able to complement information of each one.
